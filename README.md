# autocursorlock
Simple addon to fix an issue related to locking to cursor to the screen in WoW.

In World of Warcraft there is a setting 'Lock cursor to screen'. However that setting is currently bugged. It only properly works if you disable and enable the checkbox.

This addon literally does that automatically whenever you log in.
